<h3>About</h3>

<p>
  <em>I Owe Who</em> is a website where you can track and manage IOUs with friends and family. 
  Create an account at the 
  <a href="{% url 'signup' %}" class="red-text">Sign Up</a>
  page to get started.

<p>
  Once you have an account, you can send and accept new friend requests, 
  as well as manage your existing friend list, from the
  <a href="{% url 'my_profile' %}" class="red-text">My Profile</a>
  page.

<p>
  Expenses are grouped into ledgers, which can be for a group of users or just you.
  A ledger can be created from the
  <a href="{% url 'ledgers_create' %}" class="red-text">Add Ledger</a>

  Only the creator of the ledger can edit the ledger.

  To see a list of all the ledgers you've created or been added to, go to the
  <a href="{% url 'ledgers_index' %}" class="red-text">My Ledgers</a>
  page.
  Click on a ledger to view its details, including the list of expenses and the users involved.

</p>
<p>
  To add photos of a receipt to an expense, use the <em>Upload Photo</em> form when viewing the expense's details.
